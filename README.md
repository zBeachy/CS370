# CS370


    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    - The goal of this project was to build an AI agent that could navigate a maze and find the reward. In this case, the agent is posing as a pirate that is looking for treasure. I was given all the code except the TODO section, 
      wherein I was tasked with building a Q-Learning algorithm to solve the pathfinding problem. To be perfectly honest, I had a lot of issue getting this up and running, and I'm still not sure that the algorithm solves the problem.
      Perhaps it is due to my use of Visual Studio Code rather than Jupyter Notebook independently, but it seems that no matter how I changed the parameters, the end result (the final playing of the game) was not achieved and it appeared that
      the algorithm didn't move at all. This is why I suspect that I am seeing some sort of visual misinformation, as I would have expected to see some movement at least. I think the important piece here is that I developed an understanding of the
      different aspects of Q-Learning and what the different parameters would theoretically change in the implementation. 
      
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        - Computer Scientists at the most basic level utilize computer technology to solve problems. The reason why this matters can be seen by looking around at the modern world and seeing the way that computers have become an integral part into
          everyday life and in the operation of fundamentally any sort of commercial business. Computer Scientists are at the forefront of discovery for different applications the computer can be applied to to simplify and make human lives easier.
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        - Approaching problems as a computer scientist, in my mind, involves attempting to assess how a computer system can assist with the given problem. When presented with an issue, after determining the way to solve the problem, the computer
          scientist then assesses how to pass the solution into the hands of a computer system, thus automating and removing the human effort from the word needed to solve the problem.
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        - Ethics are at the pinacle of work in technology. As discussed a lot in this course, it is imperative to avoid hidden biases and to err of the side of caution in designing a system. Computers are extremely powerful tools, and like most
          powerful tools, can be used for both good and bad things. It is important that the application doesn't harm people in any sort of way but rather provides some sort of benefit. In a grey area situation, the pros must outweigh the cons,
          and there should be significant checks and balances on the system to ensure that it never has the sole control of critical systems such as power grids, weapons and defence technology, etc.
